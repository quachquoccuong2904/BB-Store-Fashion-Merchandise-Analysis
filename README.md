## 1. Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive retail analysis for **BB Store's - a fashion retailer located in the central of Ho Chi Minh City**. In recent periods, the store has experienced growth challenges due to limited leadership direction and a lack of innovative strategies. These challenges have raised critical questions around revenue performance and product strategy.

As a Data Analyst, my objective is to assess the store’s current business performance, evaluate product-related factors and customer conversion rates, and provide data-driven insights. The findings will support strategic decision-making for stakeholders and guide the development of a growth plan for the brand in the **Offline retail** segment.

### 2.1. Defining Objectives and Stakeholders

The first step was to clearly define the business objectives, rooted in the core challenges the store is facing, and to identify the key stakeholders who require actionable insights. This process began with several guiding questions:
- **What are the actual problems the business is facing?**
  - What has caused the store’s recent struggles in achieving growth? - a decline in revenue growth, an inability to develop new products, or a lack of ability to attract customers to directly compete with market rivals?
- **What is the goal of this analysis?**
  - Help the business achieve its desired growth targets in the future, potentially by adjusting business strategies or product offerings. The ultimate aim is to increase revenue and profit, attract new customers, and retain existing ones.
- **Who are the primary stakeholders?**
  - Company leadership, product development department, and sales department.
- **What are they interested in?**
  - Company leadership: Overall revenue, new customer acquisition rate, conversion rate, average transaction value, and top-performing product categories.
  - Product development department: Whether the products meet market demand, which products are the core offerings or require improvement, and whether they align with the store’s targeted customer segments.
  - Sales department: Total revenue and profit by time of the week, peak value periods, current customer conversion rate, strategies for customer retention and acquisition, and identification of products generating the most revenue.
- **How will this analysis help them solve their problems?**
  - Company leadership: Gain a clear picture of the store’s current situation to evaluate and act upon proposed recommendations.
  - Product team: Identify the true value each product brings, enabling them to restructure the product portfolio to align with the business strategy.
  - Sales team: Increase revenue and profit, and improve customer conversion rates.
